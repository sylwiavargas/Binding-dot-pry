```
   User --------------< Tweet
   :username           :content
                       :user
```

## Functionality

- `User#print_all_tweets` - `puts` a list of all tweets by a User, e.g.

"
Username:
✨ Their first tweet

✨ Their second tweet
"

^ this one needs work

- `Tweet.print_all_tweets` - `puts` a list of all tweets by all Users following the above format

^ to develop

- `User#average_tweet_length` - `puts` "NAME's average tweet length is NUMBER"

^ this one works (maybe?)

- `User.longest_tweets` - returns an instance of a User who writes the longest tweets on average

^ this one breaks?!?!
